          Razvan is a very valuable asset to my project. He started to deliver very fast on new technologies and he‚Äôs
          always looking to learn more. He is the kind of person always focused to deliver. He is looking for solutions,
          making the necessary research and always finding a way to deliver no matter how challenging. You can clearly
          see that he likes what he does as he always shows a natural enthusiasm.
